# Blaze
Blaze volume renderer and volume analytics program.

*Dependencies: Qt5, ITK, VTK, python3*  
*Required python packages: numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, plotly, prettytable*

Blaze provides the following volume analysis and rendering capabilities:
1. Performing 3D raycasting of volumetric data in color,
2. The user can edit 1D transfer function using a dialog box and add nodes for colors and transparency values,
3. The user can create 2D graph based TF and display selective volume materials/segments, and
4. Detect and remove background.
