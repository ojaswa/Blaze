File Description: 
LHDataAnalysis.py - used for reading the LH data, cluster the LH space and making the initial graph to be fed to occint.py for graph refinement.
occint.py - used for reading the occlusion - intensity data, cluster the space and use the information to refinr the graph created. 
graph_adhoc.py - contains the algorithm for robust graph deduction from the LH clusters, and creating a graph based on the input threshold.
seprtability.py - calculates a seperability energy metric for each graph to pick the best graph.
bhattacharyaDist.py - to caluculate the bhattacharya distance between two continuous probability distributions.
distanceMatrix.py - create the DM matrix containing Bhattacharya distance from each PD to other.
subSample.py - uniform binnned subsampling for LHDataAnalysis.py script use
subSample2.py - uniform binnned subsampling for occint.py script use

Output file descrition in file_output_format.txt

Flags:
skip_ss_clus_flag - to skip LH clusterin provided we already have that pre computed in a pickle file
skip_algo_flag - to skip the graph and material file writing step provided we already have the materials.txt file written.
skip_oiss_flag - to skip the occint clustering step provided we have the precomputed data in the pickle file.

Hyperparameter Settings:
LH meanshift parameter: quantile value(q)- 0<=q<=0.5 but for big datasets, good to keep at a low value, in code this is set to 0.01, this can be a test of robustness of the algorithm; minimum bin size - to speed up clustering we provide minimum bin size for the intial seeding of the algorithm, we set it to 3 to test the robustness of the algorithm. will work similarily for the occint clustering as well  

Subsampling fraction setting in the subsample.py and subsample2.py file we set it to 40% subsampling with minimum bound of 50,000 points and maximum bound of 100,000 points.
